Once upon a time in a quaint forest nestled among the towering trees, there lived three little bears. There was Papa Bear, who was big and burly, Mama Bear, who was gentle and wise, and Baby Bear, who was playful and curious. Together, they resided in a cozy cottage built of wood and leaves.

One sunny morning, Mama Bear decided to bake some delicious porridge for breakfast. While it bubbled and steamed on the stove, the bears went for a walk in the forest to pass the time. Little did they know, a mischievous fox had been watching their cottage from afar, hungry for a taste of their savory porridge.

As the bears ventured deeper into the forest, the fox seized the opportunity and sneaked into their cottage. He found the steaming pots of porridge on the table and eagerly began to taste each one. But alas, the porridge was too hot for his liking, and he burnt his tongue on the first pot, then the second, and finally the third.

Meanwhile, the bears returned home to find the intruder. Papa Bear let out a mighty roar, scaring the fox away. With the cottage safe once more, they sat down to enjoy their breakfast, finding the porridge just right. And from that day on, they kept a watchful eye on their home, living happily ever after in the heart of the forest.
